<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Kelly Kelly. I am a Web Development student who has returned to school after and extended amount of time away. I have a busy family life and am working hard to balance it with school responsibilities. In my free time I love spending time with my family, enjoy stand-up comedy shows, and listen to Ted Talks to renew my energy.</p>
<h2>What I want from this class</h2>
<p>I have high expectations about this class. I have heard that JavaScript is very intense and can be challenging. The first week has been hard to find the right balance, but I am determined to to do so and catch back up. I want to truly understand this language and have a strong working knowledge as I go into the next class. During this course, I expect myself to stay up to date, keep in communication and ask questions even if I feel silly, and try not to be intimidated by the other awesome students.</p>
<h2>Programming Experience</h2>
<p>I have taken a few programming classes. I would say me level of programming experience is still at a beginner level. I have a long way to go before I will consider myself knowledgeable in programming. I honestly enjoy the basic HTML and CSS the most. While I like the what the other languages are capable of, I love the process of creating at the most basic level. It feels powerful.
